Kanban CLI app based on [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea). 

## Built by following the below tutorial from [Charm.sh](https://charm.sh/)

## TODO
 - Save/Load state to/from file on startup/close.
 - Implement uncovered "help" view

I am leaving this product untouched for the for-seeable future. It was completed following a bubble-tea tutorial to get a better understanding of the toolset. 
I may return to it in the future, but for now I want to move on to self-driven projects
